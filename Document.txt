Eco-Friendly Chatbot Documentation
Overview
This chatbot is built to provide eco-friendly alternatives or suggestions in response to user queries about everyday items. When a user asks about an object like a "bottle" or "spoon," the chatbot automatically assumes the user is interested in an eco-friendly version and provides relevant responses.

Core Features
Eco-Friendly Context for Every Query: The chatbot ensures that every query is processed with an eco-conscious mindset, automatically assuming that the user is asking for environmentally friendly alternatives or suggestions.
Real-Time Responses: It provides instant feedback on eco-friendly products, solutions, or improvements for various common items.
Persistent Chat History: The chatbot maintains a session-specific chat history, allowing users to scroll through past interactions during their session.
Technical Components
Streamlit Interface: The chatbot runs on a web interface using Streamlit, allowing users to interact in real time through a simple chat box.
Groq Integration: Groq is used for natural language processing (NLP) to generate meaningful responses based on the input queries. The chatbot uses Groq’s model to interpret user queries with the eco-friendly context in mind.
Pinecone for Semantic Search: Pinecone is used for generating vector embeddings and conducting semantic searches to find relevant eco-friendly information or context that can enrich responses.
How It Works
User Query Input: The user types in a query, such as “bottle” or “spoon.”
Eco-Friendly Context: The chatbot internally appends “eco-friendly” to every query, ensuring that all responses are related to environmentally friendly alternatives.
Response Generation: Groq processes the query, Pinecone retrieves relevant contextual information if needed, and the chatbot replies with a message about eco-friendly options or suggestions for the queried item.
Intended Use
This chatbot is perfect for users who are interested in eco-friendly products, sustainable living tips, or greener alternatives for everyday items. The system ensures that all responses are geared toward environmental consciousness without the user needing to specify that explicitly.

User Interaction Flow
Enter Query: The user asks about any item.
Receive Eco-Friendly Suggestions: The chatbot responds with alternatives that are sustainable, recycled, or eco-conscious.
Continue Chat: The user can ask follow-up questions, and the chatbot maintains the eco-friendly theme throughout the conversation.
Customization and Scalability
Adding More Categories: The system can be expanded to include a larger variety of eco-friendly product categories, or specific preferences (e.g., biodegradable, plastic-free).
Integration with Databases: The chatbot can integrate with product databases or external APIs to provide more precise suggestions or even link to eco-friendly products available in the market.
Target Audience
This chatbot is designed for environmentally conscious consumers, individuals seeking to reduce their carbon footprint, and businesses that wish to promote eco-friendly products.
